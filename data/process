# Not exactly a shell script, as the echos probably aren't legal.
# This is the history of what I've done to the jibot data to transform 
# from separate sqlite2 dbs to a single sqlite3 db with the funky 
# ' & ' array joining undone on the def and the masternick tables.
# Also removed the +==' ' in the defs file, and removed some duplicate lines
#  

# dump and reload in a new db
for f in `ls *.sqlite`; do `sqlite $f .dump > $f.sql` ; done
cat *.sql | sqlite3 new.sqlite

# dump the defs as csv 
echo ".mode csv
.output def2.csv
select * from def;
.quit" 
| sqlite3 new.sqlite

# remove + for spaces, sort and unique so that we don't have dup lines.
tr '+' ' ' < def.csv | sort | uniq > def_clean.csv

#process
python /Users/erics/jibot/sqlite/def.py | uniq > def.sql

sqlite3 new.sqlite < def.sql

# split the masternick apart
.mode csv
.output master.csv
select * from masternick;
.quit

#process
python /Users/erics/jibot/sqlite/master.py | uniq > master.sql

sqlite3 new.sqlite < master.sql
