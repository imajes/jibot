This leaf allows the owner of the IRC bot to perform administrative commands on
the bot, such as quitting or reloading it. In order to protect such commands
from abuse, this bot uses the Authenticator module. The Authenticator method
that is used is specified by the +authentication+ option. For more information,
see the *Authentication* section of the README.

== Usage

!autumn:: Displays information about the version of Autumn that is running this
          leaf (unprotected command).
!quit:: Terminates the stem on which the message was received.
!reload:: Reloads all source files of all leaves, and all their view files.
