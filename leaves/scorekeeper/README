An Autumn Leaf used for an in-channel scorekeeping system. This can operate both
as an open or closed score system. (In the former, new members are automatically
added when they receive points; in the latter, only authorized members can give
and receive points.)

Scorekeeper is a database-backed leaf. It requires the DataMapper gem
(http://www.datamapper.org) in order to run. The database stores channels and
their members, and each member's point history.

Scorekeeper supports pseudonyms. Entries in the +pseudonyms+ table can be used
to help ensure that the correct person's points are changed even when the sender
uses a nickname or abbreviation.

Scorekeeper takes one custom configuration option, +scoring+, which can be
either "open" or "closed". A closed system only allows a specified set of users
to receive and give points. An open system allows anyone to award points to
anyone.

== Usage

!points [name]:: Get a person's score
!points [name] [+|-][number] [reason]:: Change a person's score (you must have a
                                        "+" or a "-"). A reason is optional.
!points [name] history:: Return some recent history of that person's score.
!points [name] history [time period]:: Selects history from a time period.
!points [name] history [sender]:: Selects point changes from a sender.
