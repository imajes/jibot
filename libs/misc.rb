class Numeric # :nodoc:
  
  # Possibly pluralizes a noun based on this number's value. Returns this number
  # and the noun as a string. This method attempts to use the Ruby English gem
  # if available, and falls back on the very simple default of appending an "s"
  # to the word to make it plural. If the Ruby English gem is not available, you
  # can specify a custom plural form for the word. Examples:
  #
  #  5.pluralize('dog') #=> "5 dogs"
  #  1.pluralize('car') #=> "1 car"
  #  7.pluralize('mouse', 'mice') #=> "7 mice" (only necessary if Ruby English is not installed)

      gem 'english'

      return "#{to_s} #{self == 1 ? singular : singular.plural}"
    rescue Gem::LoadError
      plural ||= singular + 's'
      return "#{to_s} #{(self == 1) ? singular : plural}"
    end
  end
end

class String # :nodoc:
  include Style
  include Words
  
  # Returns a copy of this string with the first character dropped.
  
  def except_first
    self[1, size-1]

end

class Hash # :nodoc:
  
  # Returns a hash that gives back the key if it has no value for that key.
  
  def self.parroting(hsh={})
    hsh ||= Hash.new
    Hash.new { |h, k| k }.update(hsh)

# An implementation of +SizedQueue+ that, instead of blocking when the queue is
# full, simply discards the overflow, forgetting it.

class ForgetfulQueue < Queue # :nodoc:
  
  # Creates a new sized queue.
  
  def initialize(capacity)
    @max = capacity
  end
  
  # Returns true if this queue is at maximum size.
  
  def full?
    size == @max
  end
  
  # Pushes an object onto the queue. If there is no space left on the queue,
  # does nothing.
  
  def push(obj)
    Thread.exclusive { super unless full? }
  end
  alias_method :<<, :push
  alias_method :enq, :push
end

# Adds the only method to Set.

class Set # :nodoc:
  
  # Returns the only element of a one-element set. Raises an exception if there
  # isn't exactly one element in the set.
  
  def only
    raise IndexError, "Set#only called on non-single-element set" unless size == 1
    to_a.first
