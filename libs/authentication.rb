module Autumn
  
  # Defines classes which each encapsulate a different strategy for
  # authentication. When the +authentication+ option is specified (see the
  # Autumn::Leaf class), the options given are used to choose the correct class
  # within this module to serve as the authenticator for that leaf.
  #
  # These authentication strategies are used to ensure only authorized users
  # have access to protected commands. Leaf authors can designate certain
  # commands as protected.
  #
  # = Writing Your Own Authenticators
  #
  # When the Autumn::Leaf#authenticate method is called, it converts the symbol
  # from snake_case to CamelCase, and looks for a class in this model. Thus, a
  # call to <tt>authenticate :hostname</tt> would look for a class
  # Autumn::Authentication::Hostname.
  #
  # To define your own authenticator, subclass Autumn::Authentication::Base as a
  # new class in the Autumn::Authentication module. Implement the methods
  # defined in the Autumn::Authentication::Base class docs, then adjust your
  # configuration to use your new authenticator.
  
  module Authentication
    
    # The basic subclass for all authenticators. If you wish to write your own
    # authenticator, you must subclass this class. You must at a minimum
    # override the authenticate method. You should also override the initialize
    # method if you need to store any options or other data for later use.
    #
    # The authentication module will become a stem listener, so see
    # Autumn::Stem#add_listener for information on other methods you can
    # implement.
