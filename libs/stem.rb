module Autumn
  
  # A connection to an IRC server. The stem acts as the IRC client on which a
  # Leaf runs. It receives messages from the IRC server and sends messages to
  # the server. Stem is compatible with many IRC daemons; details of the IRC
  # protocol are handled by a Daemon instance. (See "Compatibility with
  # Different Server Types," below).
  #
  # Generally stems are initialized by the Foliater, but should you want to
  # instantiate one yourself, a Stem is instantiated with a server to connect to
  # and a nickname to acquire (see the initialize method docs). Once you
  # initialize a Stem, you should call add_listener one or more times to
  # indicate to the stem what objects are interested in working with it.
  #
  # = Listeners and Listener Plug-Ins
  #
  # An object that functions as a listener should conform to an implicit
  # protocol. See the add_listener docs for more infortmation on what methods
  # you can implement to listen for IRC events. Duck typing is used -- you need
  # not implement every method of the protocol, only those you are concerned
  # with.
  #
  # Listeners can also act as plugins: Such listeners add functionality to
  # other listeners (for example, a CTCP listener that adds CTCP support to
  # other listeners, such as a Leaf instance). For more information, see the
  # add_listener docs.
  #
  # = Starting the IRC Session
  #
  # Once you have finished configuring your stem and you are ready to begin the
  # IRC session, call the start method. This method blocks until the the socket
  # has been closed, so it should be run in a thread. Once the connection has
  # been made, you are free to send and receive IRC commands until you close the
  # connection, which is done with the quit method.
  #
  # = Receiving and Sending IRC Commands
  #
  # Receiving events is explained in the add_listener docs. To send an IRC
  # command, simply call a method named after the command name. For instance, if
  # you wish to PRIVMSG another nick, call the +privmsg+ method. If you wish to
  # JOIN a channel, call the +join+ method. The parameters should be specified
  # in the same order as the IRC command expects.
  #
  # For more information on what IRC commands are "method-ized", see the
  # +IRC_COMMANDS+ constant. For more information on the proper way to use these
  # commands (and thus, the methods that call them), consult the Daemon class.
  #
  # = Compatibility with Different Server Types
  #
  # Many different IRC server daemons exist, and each one has a slightly
  # different IRC implementation. To manage this, there is an option called
  # +server_type+, which is set automatically by the stem if it can determine
  # the IRC software that the server is running. Server types are instances of
  # the Daemon class, and are associated with a name. A stem's server type
  # affects things like response codes, user modes, and channel modes, as these
  # vary from server to server.
  #
  # If the stem is unsure what IRC daemon your server is running, it will use
  # the default Daemon instance. This default server type will be compatible
  # with nearly every server out there. You may not be able to leverage some of
  # the more esoteric IRC features of your particular server, but for the most
  # common uses of IRC (sending and receiving messages, for example), it will
  # suffice.
  #
  # If you'd like to manually specify a server type, you can pass its name for
  # the +server_type+ initialization option. Consult the resources/daemons
  # directory for valid Daemon names and hints on how to make your own Daemon
  # specification, should you desire.
  #
  # = Channel Names
  #
  # The convention for Autumn channel names is: When you specify a channel to
  # an Autumn stem, you can (but don't have to) prefix it with the '#'
  # character, if it's a normal IRC channel. When an Autumn stem gives a channel
  # name to you, it will always start with the '#' character (assuming it's a
  # normal IRC channel, of course). If your channel is prefixed with a different
  # character (say, '&'), you will need to include that prefix every time you
  # pass a channel name to a stem method.
  #
  # So, if you would like your stem to send a message to the "##kittens"
  # channel, you can omit the '#' character; but if it's a server-local channel
  # called "&kittens", you will have to provide the '&' character. Likewise, if
  # you are overriding a hook method, you can be guaranteed that the channel
  # given to you will always be called "##kittens", and not "kittens".
  #
  # = Synchronous Methods
  #
  # Because new messages are received and processed in separate threads, methods
  # can sometimes receive messages out of order (for instance, if a first
  # message takes a long time to process and a second message takes a short time
  # to process). In the event that you require a guarantee that your method will
  # receive messages in order, and that it will only be invoked in a single
  # thread, annotate your method with the +stem_sync+ property.
  #
  # For instance, you might want to ensure that you are finished processing 353
  # messages (replies to NAMES commands) before you tackle 366 messages (end of
  # NAMES list). To ensure these methods are invoked in the correct order:
  #
  #  class MyListener
  #    def irc_rpl_namreply_response(stem, sender, recipient, arguments, msg)
  #      [...]
  #    end
  #    
  #    def irc_rpl_endofnames_response(stem, sender, recipient, arguments, msg)
  #      [...]
  #    end
  #    
  #    ann :irc_rpl_namreply_response, :stem_sync => true
  #    ann :irc_rpl_endofnames_response, :stem_sync => true
  #  end
  #
  # All such methods will be run in a single thread, and will receive server
  # messages in order. Because of this, it is important that synchronized
  # methods do not spend a lot of time processing a single message, as it forces
  # all other synchronous methods to wait their turn.
  #
  # This annotation is only relevant to "invoked" methods, those methods in
  # listeners that are invoked by the stem's broadcast method. Methods that are
  # marked with this annotation will also run faster, because they don't have
  # the overhead of setting up a new thread.
  #
  # Many of Stem's own internal methods are synchronized, to ensure internal
  # data such as the channels list and channel members list stays consistent.
  # Because of this, any method marked as synchronized can be guaranteed that
  # the stem's channel data is consistent and "in sync" for the moment of time
  # that the message was received.

    # Adds an object that will receive notifications of incoming IRC messages.
    # For each IRC event that the listener is interested in, the listener should
    # implement a method in the form <tt>irc_[event]_event</tt>, where [event]
    # is the name of the event, as taken from the +IRC_COMMANDS+ hash. For
    # example, to register interest in PRIVMSG events, implement the method:
    #
    #  irc_privmsg_event(stem, sender, arguments)
    #
    # If you wish to perform an operation each time any IRC event is received,
    # you can implement the method:
    #
    #  irc_event(stem, command, sender, arguments)
    #
    # The parameters for both methods are as follows:
    #
    # +stem+:: This Stem instance.
    # +sender+:: A sender hash (see the Leaf docs).
    # +arguments+:: A hash whose keys depend on the IRC command. Keys can be,
    #               for example, <tt>:recipient</tt>, <tt>:channel</tt>,
    #               <tt>:mode</tt>, or <tt>:message</tt>. Any can be nil.
    #
    # The +irc_event+ method also receives the command name as a symbol.
    #
    # In addition to events, the Stem will also pass IRC server responses along
    # to its listeners. Known responses (those specified by the Daemon) are
    # translated to programmer-friendly symbols using the Daemon.event hash. The
    # rest are left in numerical form.
    #
    # If you wish to register interest in a response code, implement a method of
    # the form <tt>irc_[response]_response</tt>, where [response] is the symbol
    # or numerical form of the response. For instance, to register interest in
    # channel-full errors, you'd implement:
    #
    #  irc_err_channelisfull_response(stem, sender, recipient, arguments, msg)
    #
    # You can also register an interest in all server responses by implementing:
    #
    #  irc_response(stem, response, sender, recipient, arguments, msg)
    #
    # This method is invoked when the server sends a response message. The
    # parameters for both methods are:
    #
    # +sender+:: The server's address.
    # +recipient+:: The nick of the recipient (sometimes "*" if no nick has been
    #               assigned yet).
    # +arguments+:: Array of response arguments, as strings.
    # +message+:: An additional message attached to the end of the response.
    #
    # The +irc_server_response+ method additionally receives the response code
    # as a symbol or numerical parameter.
    #
    # Please note that there are hundreds of possible responses, and IRC servers
    # differ in what information they send along with each response code. I
    # recommend inspecting the output of the specific IRC server you are working
    # with, so you know what arguments to expect.
    #
    # If your listener is interested in IRC server notices, implement the
    # method:
    #
    #  irc_server_notice(stem, server, sender, msg)
    #
    # This method will be invoked for notices from the IRC server. Its
    # parameters are:
    #
    # +server+:: The server's address.
    # +sender+:: The message originator (e.g., "Auth" for authentication-related
    #            messages).
    # +msg+:: The notice.
    #
    # If your listener is interested in IRC server errors, implement the method:
    #
    #  irc_server_error(stem, msg)
    #
    # This method will be invoked whenever an IRC server reports an error, and
    # is passed the error message. Server errors differ from normal server
    # responses, which themselves can sometimes indicate errors.
    #
    # Some listeners can act as listener plugins; see the broadcast method for
    # more information.
    #
    # If you'd like your listener to perform actions after it's been added to a
    # Stem, implement a method called +added+. This method will be called when
    # the listener is added to a stem, and will be passed the Stem instance it
    # was added to. You can use this method, for instance, to add additional
    # methods to the stem.
    #
    # Your listener can implement the +stem_ready+ method, which will be called
    # once the stem has started up, connected to the server, and joined all its
    # channels. This method is passed the stem instance.

    # Sends the method with the name +meth+ (a symbol) to all listeners that

    # This method is meant for use by <b>listener plugins</b>: listeners that
    # add features to other listeners by allowing them to implement optional
    # methods.
    #
    # For example, you might have a listener plugin that adds CTCP support to
    # stems. Such a method would parse incoming messages for CTCP commands, and
    # then use the broadcast method to call methods named after those commands.
    # Other listeners who want to use CTCP support can implement the methods
    # that your listener plugin broadcasts.
    #
