module Autumn
  
  # This is the superclass that all Autumn leaves use. To write a leaf, sublcass
  # this class and implement methods for each of your leaf's commands. Your
  # leaf's repertoire of commands is derived from the names of the methods you
  # write. For instance, to have your leaf respond to a "!hello" command in IRC,
  # write a method like so:
  # 
  #  def hello_command(stem, sender, reply_to, msg)
  #    stem.message "Why hello there!", reply_to
  #  end
  #
  # You can also implement this method as:
  #
  #  def hello_command(stem, sender, reply_to, msg)
  #    return "Why hello there!"
  #  end
  #
  # Methods of the form <tt>[word]_command</tt> tell the leaf to respond to
  # commands in IRC of the form "![word]". They should accept four parameters:
  #
  # 1. the Stem that received the message,
  # 2. the sender hash for the person who sent the message (see below),
  # 3. the "reply-to" string (either the name of the channel that the command
  #    was typed on, or the nick of the person that whispered the message), and
  # 4. any text following the command. For instance, if the person typed "!eat A
  #    tasty slice of pizza", the last parameter would be "A tasty slice of
  #    pizza". This is nil if no text was supplied with the command.
  #
  # <b>Sender hashes:</b> A "sender hash" is a hash with the following keys:
  # +nick+ (the user's nickname), +user+ (the user's username), and +host+ (the
  # user's hostname). Any of these fields except +nick+ could be nil. Sender
  # hashes are used throughout the Stem and Leaf classes, as well as other
  # classes; they always have the same keys.
  # 
  # If your <tt>*_command</tt> method returns a string, it will be sent as an
  # IRC message to "reply-to" parameter.If your leaf needs to respond to more
  # complicated commands, you will have to override the
  # did_receive_channel_message method (see below). If you like, you can remove
  # the quit_command method in your subclass, for instance, to prevent the leaf
  # from responding to !quit. You can also protect that method using filters
  # (see "Filters").
  #
  # If you want to separate view logic from the controller, you can use ERb to
  # template your views. See the render method for more information.
  #
  # = Hook Methods
  #
  # Aside from adding your own <tt>*_command</tt>-type methods, you should
  # investigate overriding the "hook" methods, such as will_start_up,
  # did_start_up, did_receive_private_message, did_receive_channel_message, etc.
  # There's a laundry list of so-named methods you can override. Their default
  # implementations do nothing, so there's no need to call +super+.
  #
  # = Stem Convenience Methods
  #
  # Most of the IRC actions (such as joining and leaving a channel, setting a
  # topic, etc.) are part of a Stem object. If your leaf is only running off
  # of one stem, you can call these stem methods directly, as if they were
  # methods in the Leaf class. Otherwise, you will need to specify which stem
  # to perform these IRC actions on. Usually, the stem is given to you, as a
  # parameter for your <tt>*_command</tt> method, for instance.
  #
  # For the sake of convenience, you can make Stem method calls on the +stems+
  # attribute; these calls will be forwarded to every stem in the +stems+
  # attribute. For instance, to broadcast a message to all servers and all
  # channels:
  #
  #  stems.message "Ready for orders!"
  #
  # = Filters
  #
  # Like Ruby on Rails, you can add filters to each of your commands to be
  # executed before or after the command is run. You can do this using the
  # before_filter and after_filter methods, just like in Rails. Filters are run
  # in the order they are added to the chain. Thus, if you wanted to run your
  # preload filter before you ran your cache filter, you'd write the calls in
  # this order:
  #
  #  class MyLeaf < Leaf
  #    before_filter :my_preload
  #    before_filter :my_cache
  #  end
  #
  # See the documentation for the before_filter and after_filter methods and the
  # README file for more information on filters.
  #
  # = Authentication
  #
  # If a leaf is initialized with a hash for the +authentication+ option, the
  # values of that hash are used to choose an authenticator that will be run
  # before each command. This authenticator will determine whether or not the
  # user can run that command. The options that can be specified in this hash
  # are:
  #
  # +type+:: The name of a class in the Autumn::Authentication module, in
  #          snake_case. Thus, if you wanted to use the
  #          Autumn::Authentication::Password class, which does password-based
  #          authentication, you'd set this value to +password+.
  # +only+:: A list of protected commands for which authentication is required;
  #          all other commands are unprotected.
  # +except+:: A list of unprotected commands; all other commands require
  #            authentication.
  # +silent+:: Normally, when someone fails to authenticate himself before
  #            running a protected command, the leaf responds with an error
  #            message (e.g., "You have to authenticate with a password first").
  #            Set this to true to suppress this behaivor.
  #
  # In addition, you can also specify any custom options for your authenticator.
  # These options are passed to the authenticator's initialize method. See the
  # classes in the Autumn::Authentication module for such options.
  #
  # If you annotate a command method as protected, the authenticator will be run
  # unconditionally, regardless of the +only+ or +except+ options:
  #
  #  class Controller < Autumn::Leaf
  #    def destructive_command(stem, sender, reply_to, msg)
  #      # ...
  #    end
  #    ann :destructive_command, :protected => true
  #  end
  #
  # = Logging
  #
  # Autumn comes with a framework for logging as well. It's very similar to the
  # Ruby on Rails logging framework. To log an error message:
  #
  #  logger.error "Quiz data is missing!"
  #
  # By default the logger will only log +info+ events and above in production
  # seasons, and will log all messages for debug seasons. (See the README for
  # more on seasons.) To customize the logger, and for more information on
  # logging, see the LogFacade class documentation.
  #
  # = Colorizing and Formatting Text
  #
  # The Autumn::Formatting module contains sub-modules which handle formatting
  # for different clients (such as mIRC-style formatting, the most common). The
  # specific formatting module that's included depends on the leaf's
  # initialization options; see initialize.

    #                                  commands sent in private messages.
    # +logger+:: The LogFacade instance for this leaf.
    # +database+:: The name of a custom database connection to use.

    #               formatter (chooses Autumn::Formatting::DEFAULT by default).
