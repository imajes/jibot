# Defines the Autumn::Speciator class, which stores the configurations of many
# Autumn objects.

require 'singleton'

module Autumn

  # The Speciator stores the global, season, stem, and leaf configurations. It
  # generates composite hashes, so that any leaf or stem can know its specific
  # configuration as a combination of its options and those of the scopes above
  # it.
  #
  # Smaller scopes override larger ones; any season-specific options will
  # replace global options, and leaf or stem options will overwrite season
  # options. Leaf and stem options are independent from each other, however,
  # since leaves and stems share a many-to-many relationship.
  #
  # Option identifiers can be specified as strings or symbols but are always
  # stored as symbols and never accessed as strings.
  #
  # This is a singleton class; only one instance of it exists for any Autumn
  # process. However, for the sake of convenience, many other objects use a
  # +config+ attribute containing the instance.
