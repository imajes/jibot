# Defines the Autumn::StemFacade class, which provides additional convenience
# methods to Autumn::Stem.

module Autumn
  
  # A collection of convenience methods that are added to the Stem class. These
  # methods serve two purposes; one, to allow easier backwards compatibility
  # with Autumn Leaves 1.0 (which had a simpler one-stem-per-leaf approach), and
  # two, to make it easier or more Ruby-like to perform certain IRC actions.

    # "#" will not be added before the channel name for you.
