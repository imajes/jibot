h2. About Autumn 

Autumn is a full-featured framework on top of which IRC bots (called "leaves")
can be quickly and easily built. It features a very Ruby-like approach to
bot-writing, a complete framework for loading and daemonizing your bots,
multiple environment contexts, a database-backed model, and painless logging
support.

h2. Requirements

Autumn requires "RubyGems":http://www.rubygems.org and the Daemons and Facets*
gems. Install RubyGems then run @sudo gem install daemons facets@ in a command
line in order to run Autumn.

Jibot requires the ruby-sqlite3 gem: @sudo gem install -v 0.9.2 do_sqlite3@  and the 
"Datamapper":http://datamapper.org/ gem: @sudo gem install install dm-core@ .

h2. Hacking JIBOT

You should peruse README.autumn first, to get a feel for how it's structured. 
Then, feel free to hack on a leaf (or create your own) to add or augment bot 
functionality.
